Description: spsann offers many optimizing criteria for sampling for variogram
    estimation (PPL), trend estimation (ACDC), and spatial
    interpolation (MSSD). spsann also includes an optimizing criterion
    for when the model of spatial variation is known (MKV). PPL, ACDC
    and MSSD were combined (PAN) for sampling when we are ignorant
    about the model of spatial variation. The user can also define his/her own
    objective function and plug it in the spatial simulated annealing algorithm.
