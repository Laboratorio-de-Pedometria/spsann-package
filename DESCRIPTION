Description: Methods to optimize sample configurations using spatial simulated 
    annealing. Multiple objective functions are implemented for various 
    purposes, such as variogram estimation, trend estimation, and spatial 
    interpolation. A general purpose spatial simulated annealing function
    enables the user to define his/her own objective function.
