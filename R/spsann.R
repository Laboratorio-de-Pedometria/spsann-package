#' spsann: optimization of sample configurations using spatial simulated 
#' annealing
#' 
#' The \strong{spsann} package is the tool for the optimization of sample
#' configurations using spatial simulated annealing in R. Spatial simulated 
#' annealing is a well known method with widespread use to solve optimization
#' problems in the environmental sciences. This is mainly due to its
#' robustness against local optima.
#' 
#' The \strong{spsann} functions offer many optimizing criteria for sampling for
#' variogram estimation (number of points or point-pairs per lag distance class 
#' - PPL), trend estimation (association/correlation and marginal distribution
#' of the covariates - ACDC), and spatial interpolation (mean squared shortest
#' distance - MSSD). \strong{spsann} also includes as an optimizing criterion 
#' the mean (or maximum) kriging variance (MUKV), which is useful when
#' the model of spatial variation is known. PPL, ACDC and MSSD were combined 
#' (PAN) for sampling when we are ignorant about the model of spatial variation
#' (\emph{terra incognita}). The user can also define his/her own objective
#' function and plug it in the spatial simulated annealing algorithm.

#' @section Support:
#' The \strong{spsann} package was initially developed as part of the PhD
#' research project entitled \sQuote{Contribution to the Construction of Models
#' for Predicting Soil Properties}, developed by Alessandro Samuel-Rosa
#' under the supervision of LÃºcia Helena Cunha dos Anjos (Universidade
#' Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Gustavo de Mattos Vasques
#' (Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and Gerard B. M. Heuvelink (ISRIC - World Soil
#' Information, the Netherlands). The project was/is supported from 2012 to 
#' 2016 by the CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, and the CNPq
#' Foundation, Ministry of Science and Technology of Brazil.
