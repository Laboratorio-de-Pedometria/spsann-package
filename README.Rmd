The __spsann__ package was created to help you designing optimum spatial sample configurations
using the power of spatial simulated annealing in [R][rproject].

## Installation

The latest stable version of the __spsann__ package generally can be downloaded from the
_Comprehensive R Archive Network_ ([CRAN][cran]).

```R
# Install the spsann package from CRAN
install.packages(pkgs = "spsann")
```

If the installation from CRAN fails, you can install the development version of the __spsann__
package available on [GitHub][github] using the __remotes__ package. If you are using a
[Windows][windows] machine, however, you will have to install [Rtools][rtools] first.

```R
# Install the spsann package from GitHub
if (!require(remotes)) {
  install.packages(pkgs = "remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(repo = "laboratorio-de-pedometria/spsann-package")
```

## How to collaborate

We use the _fork & pull_ collaborative development model. This means that you are free to make a
parallel copy of this repository, change the source code as you see fit, and then _push_ the
changes to your personal copy of this repository. All this without requiring any authorization. If
the changes you've made to your personal copy of this repository are interesting and you're willing
to share them with us, then just have them pulled -- _pull request_ -- to this repository. After
reviewing the changes, we will decide whether they can be merged -- _merge_ -- with the source code
of this repository.
