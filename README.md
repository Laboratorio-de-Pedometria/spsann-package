# How to collaborate

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model. This means that 
anyone can fork the `spsann` repository and push changes to their personal fork
without requiring access be granted to the source `spsann` repository. The 
changes will be reviewed and, if pertinent, will be pulled into the source
`spsann` repository by the project maintainers.

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model mainly because it 
reduces the amount of friction for new contributors. It makes it easier for
others to contribute. Besides, it is very popular with open source projects 
because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

how to fork a repository and make pull requests.
