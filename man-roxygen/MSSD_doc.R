#' @section Spatial coverage sampling:
#' Spatial coverage sampling is based on the knowledge that the kriging variance depends upon the distance 
#' between sample points. As such, the better the spread of the sample points in the spatial domain, the 
#' smaller the kriging variance. This is similar to using a regular grid of sample points. However, 
#' a regular grid usually is suboptimal for irregularly shaped areas.
