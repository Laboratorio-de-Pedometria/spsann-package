and estimation (III)}
\usage{
optimACDC(points, candi, covars, strata.type = "area", use.coords = FALSE,
  schedule = scheduleSPSANN(), plotit = FALSE, track = FALSE, boundary,
  progress = "txt", verbose = FALSE, weights = list(CORR = 0.5, DIST =
  0.5), nadir = list(sim = NULL, seeds = NULL, user = NULL, abs = NULL),

objACDC(points, candi, covars, strata.type = "area", use.coords = FALSE,

  NULL, user = NULL, abs = NULL), utopia = list(user = NULL, abs = NULL))
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{Integer value, integer vector, data frame or matrix. If
\code{points} is an integer value, it defines the number of points that
should be randomly sampled from \code{candi} to form the starting system
configuration. If \code{points} is a vector of integer values, it contains
the row indexes of \code{candi} that correspond to the points that form the
starting system configuration. If \code{points} is a data frame or matrix,
it must have three columns in the following order: \code{[, "id"]} the
row indexes of \code{candi} that correspond to each point, \code{[, "x"]}
the projected x-coordinates, and \code{[, "y"]} the projected y-coordinates.
Note that in the later case, \code{points} must be a subset of \code{candi}.}

\item{candi}{Data frame or matrix with the candidate locations for the
jittered points. \code{candi} must have two columns in the following
order: \code{[, "x"]} the projected x-coordinates, and \code{[, "y"]} the
projected y-coordinates.}

\item{covars}{Data frame or matrix with the covariates in the columns.}

\item{strata.type}{Character value setting the type of stratification that
should be used to create the marginal sampling strata (or factor levels) for
the numeric covariates. Available options are \code{"area"}, for equal-area,
and \code{"range"}, for equal-range. Defaults to \code{strata.type = "area"}.}

\item{use.coords}{Logical value. Should the geographic coordinates be used
as covariates? Defaults to \code{use.coords = FALSE}.}

\item{schedule}{List with 11 named sub-arguments defining the control
parameters of the cooling schedule. See \code{\link[spsann]{scheduleSPSANN}}.}

\item{plotit}{Logical for plotting the optimization results, including
a) the progress of the objective function, and b) the starting (gray) and
current system configuration (black), and the maximum jitter in the
x- and y-coordinates. The plots are updated at each 10 jitters. Defaults to
\code{plotit = FALSE}.}

\item{track}{Logical value. Should the evolution of the energy state be
recorded and returned with the result? If \code{track = FALSE} (the default),
only the starting and ending energy states are returned with the results.}

\item{boundary}{SpatialPolygon defining the boundary of the spatial domain.
If missing and \code{plotit = TRUE}, \code{boundary} is estimated from
\code{candi}.}

\item{progress}{Type of progress bar that should be used, with options
\code{"txt"}, for a text progress bar in the R console, \code{"tk"}, to put
up a Tk progress bar widget, and \code{NULL} to omit the progress bar.
A Tk progress bar widget is usefull when using parallel processors. Defaults
to \code{progress = "txt"}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical for printing messages about the progress of the
optimization. Defaults to \code{verbose = FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{List with named sub-arguments. The weights assigned to each
one of the objective functions that form the multi-objective optimization
problem (MOOP). They must be named after the respective objective function
to which they apply. The weights must be equal to or larger than 0 and sum
to 1. The default option gives equal weights to all objective functions.}

\item{nadir}{List with named sub-arguments. Three options are available:
1) \code{sim} -- the number of simulations that should be used to estimate
the nadir point, and \code{seeds} -- vector defining the random seeds for
each simulation; 2) \code{user} -- a list of user-defined nadir values named
after the respective objective functions to which they apply; 3) \code{abs}
-- logical for calculating the nadir point internally (experimental).}

\item{utopia}{List with named sub-arguments. Two options are available: 1)
\code{user} -- a list of user-defined values named after the respective
objective functions to which they apply; 2) \code{abs} -- logical for
calculating the utopia point internally (experimental).}
}
\value{
\code{optimACDC} returns a matrix: the optimized sample configuration.

\code{objACDC} returns a numeric value: the energy state of the sample
configuration - the objective function value.
}
\description{
Optimize a sample configuration for spatial trend identification and
estimation. An utility function \emph{U} is defined so that the sample
reproduces the bivariate association/correlation between the covariates, as
well as their marginal distribution (\bold{ACDC}). The utility function is
obtained aggregating two objective functions: \bold{CORR} and
\bold{DIST}.
}
\note{
The distance between two points is computed as the Euclidean distance between
them. This computation assumes that the optimization is operating in the
two-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. the coordinates of the sample points
and candidate locations should not be provided as latitude/longitude.
The \pkg{spsann}-package has no mechanism to check if the coordinates are
projected: the user is responsible for making sure that this requirement
is attained.

This function was derived with modifications from the method known as the
\emph{conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling} originally proposed by Minasny
and McBratney (2006), and implemented in the R-package
\pkg{\link[clhs]{clhs}} by Pierre Roudier.
}
\section{Multi-objective optimization}{

The multi-objective optimization problem is solved aggregating the objective
functions into a single \emph{utility function} using the \emph{weighted
sum method}. Because the \emph{weighted sum method} is affected by the
relative magnitude of the different function values, each objective function
is transformed before the aggregation. Four transformation methods are
available.

The \emph{upper-lower-bound approach} results in function values constrained
between 0 and 1. The user has to inform the maximum (nadir point) and
minimum (utopia point) absolute function values. With the \emph{upper-bound
approach}, the function values will always be smaller than or equal to 1.
The user has to inform only the nadir point, the utopia point being set to
zero. An option is to use \emph{numerical simulations} to approximate the
nadir point, but this should be avoided. We recoment using the
\emph{upper-lower-bound approach} with the \emph{Pareto maximum and minimum
values}. It works as follows:

\enumerate{
  \item Optimize a sample configuration with respect to each objective
 function that composes the MOOP;
  \item Compute the function value of every objective function that composes
  the MOOP for every optimized sample configuration;
  \item Record the maximum and minimum absolute function values computed for
  each objective function that composes the MOOP -- these are the Pareto
  maximum and minimum.
}

For example, consider that a MOOP is composed of two objective functions: A
and B. The minimum absolute value for function A is obtained when the sample
configuration is optimized with respect to function A. This is the Pareto
minimum of function A. Consequently, the maximum absolute value for function
A is obtained when the sample configuration is optimized regarding function
B. This is the Pareto maximum of function A. The same logic applies for
function B.
}

\section{Association/Correlation between covariates}{

The \emph{correlation} between two numeric covariates is measured using the
Pearson's \emph{r}, a descriptive statistic that ranges from $-1$ to $+1$.
The \emph{association} between two factor covariates is measured using the
Cram√©r's \emph{v}, a descriptive statistic that ranges from $0$ to $+1$.
}

\section{Marginal distribution of covariates}{


\emph{Equal-area} marginal sampling strata are defined using the unique
sample quantiles estimated with \code{\link[stats]{quantile}} using a
discontinuous function (\code{type = 3}). This is to avoid creating empty
marginal sampling strata.

\emph{Equal-range} marginal sampling strata are defined by breaking the range
of covariate values into pieces of equal size. Any empty marginal sampling
strata is merged with the closest non-empty marginal sampling strata.
