\usage{
optimCLHS(points, candi, covars, use.coords = FALSE,
  schedule = scheduleSPSANN(), plotit = FALSE, track = FALSE, boundary,
  progress = "txt", verbose = FALSE, weights = list(O1 = 1/3, O2 = 1/3, O3
  = 1/3))

objCLHS(points, candi, covars, use.coords = FALSE, weights = list(O1 = 1/3,
  O2 = 1/3, O3 = 1/3))
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{Integer value, integer vector, data frame or matrix, or list.
\itemize{
\item Integer value. The number of points. These points will be randomly sampled from \code{candi} to form
the starting sample configuration.
\item Integer vector. The row indexes of \code{candi} that correspond to the points that form the starting
sample configuration. The length of the vector defines the number of points.
\item Data frame or matrix. An object with three columns in the following order: \code{[, "id"]}, the 
row indexes of \code{candi} that correspond to each point, \code{[, "x"]}, the projected x-coordinates, and
\code{[, "y"]}, the projected y-coordinates.
\item List. An object with two named sub-arguments: \code{fixed}, a data frame or matrix with the projected
x- and y-coordinates of the existing sample configuration -- kept fixed during the optimization --, and 
\code{free}, an integer value defining the number of points that should be added to the existing sample
configuration -- free to move during the optimization.
}}

\item{candi}{Data frame or matrix with the candidate locations for the jittered points. \code{candi} must 
have two columns in the following order: \code{[, "x"]}, the projected x-coordinates, and \code{[, "y"]}, 
the projected y-coordinates.}

\item{covars}{Data frame or matrix with the covariates in the columns.}

\item{use.coords}{(Optional) Logical value. Should the spatial x- and y-coordinates be used as covariates? 
Defaults to \code{use.coords = FALSE}.}

\item{schedule}{List with 11 named sub-arguments defining the control parameters of the cooling schedule. 
See \code{\link[spsann]{scheduleSPSANN}}.}

\item{plotit}{(Optional) Logical for plotting the optimization results, including a) the progress of the
objective function, and b) the starting (gray circles) and current sample configuration (black dots), and 
the maximum jitter in the x- and y-coordinates. The plots are updated at each 10 jitters. When adding 
points to an existing sample configuration, fixed points are indicated using black crosses. Defaults to 
\code{plotit = FALSE}.}

\item{track}{(Optional) Logical value. Should the evolution of the energy state be recorded and returned 
along with the result? If \code{track = FALSE} (the default), only the starting and ending energy states 
are returned along with the results.}

\item{boundary}{(Optional) SpatialPolygon defining the boundary of the spatial domain. If missing and 
\code{plotit = TRUE}, \code{boundary} is estimated from \code{candi}.}

\item{progress}{(Optional) Type of progress bar that should be used, with options \code{"txt"}, for a text
progress bar in the R console, \code{"tk"}, to put up a Tk progress bar widget, and \code{NULL} to omit the
progress bar. A Tk progress bar widget is useful when using parallel processors. Defaults to 
\code{progress = "txt"}.}

\item{verbose}{(Optional) Logical for printing messages about the progress of the optimization. Defaults to 
\code{verbose = FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{List with named sub-arguments. The weights assigned to each one of the objective functions
that form the multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. They must be named after the respective 
objective function to which they apply. The weights must be equal to or larger than 0 and sum to 1. The 
default option gives equal weights to all objective functions.}
}
\value{
\code{optimCLHS} returns an object of class \code{OptimizedSampleConfiguration}: the optimized sample
configuration with details about the optimization.

\code{objCLHS} returns a numeric value: the energy state of the sample configuration -- the objective
function value.

\description{
Optimize a sample configuration for spatial trend identification and estimation using the method proposed 
by Minasny and McBratney (2006), known as the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. An utility function 
\emph{U} is defined so that the sample reproduces the marginal distribution and correlation matrix of the
numeric covariates, and the class proportions of the factor covariates (\bold{CLHS}). The utility function 
is obtained aggregating three objective functions: \bold{O1}, \bold{O2}, and \bold{O3}.
}
\details{
Details about the mechanism used to generate a new sample configuration out of the current sample 
configuration by randomly perturbing the coordinates of a sample point are available in the help page of
\code{\link[spsann]{spJitter}}.

\subsection{Marginal sampling strata}{
#' Reproducing the marginal distribution of the numeric covariates depends upon the definition of marginal 
sampling strata. \emph{Equal-area} marginal sampling strata are defined using the sample quantiles 
estimated with \code{\link[stats]{quantile}} using a continuous function (\code{type = 7}), that is, a 
function that interpolates between existing covariate values to estimate the sample quantiles. This is 
the procedure implemented in the method of Minasny and McBratney (2006), which creates breakpoints that do 
not occur in the population of existing covariate values. Depending on the level of discretization of the 
covariate values, that is, how many significant digits they have, this can create repeated breakpoints, 
resulting in empty marginal sampling strata. The number of empty marginal sampling strata will ultimately
depend on the frequency distribution of the covariate and on the number of sampling points. The effect of
these features on the spatial modelling outcome still is poorly understood.
}
\subsection{Correlation between numeric covariates}{
The \emph{correlation} between two numeric covariates is measured using the sample Pearson's \emph{r}, a 
descriptive statistic that ranges from $-1$ to $+1$. This statistic is also known as the sample linear 
correlation coefficient. The effect of ignoring the correlation among factor covariates and between 
factor and numeric covariates on the spatial modelling outcome still is poorly understood.
}
\subsection{Multi-objective combinatorial optimization}{
A method of solving a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem (MOCOP) is to aggregate the 
objective functions into a single utility function \emph{U}. In the \pkg{spsann} package, as in the 
original implementation of the CLHS by Minasny and McBratney (2006), the aggregation is performed using 
the \emph{weighted sum method}, which uses weights to incorporate the preferences of the user about the 
relative importance of each objective function. When the user has no preference, the objective functions 
receive equal weights.

The weighted sum method is affected by the relative magnitude of the different objective function values. 
The objective functions implemented in \code{optimCLHS} have different units and orders of magnitude. The 
consequence is that the objective function with the largest values, generally \bold{O1}, may have a 
numerical dominance during the optimization. In other words, the weights may not express the true 
preferences of the user, resulting that the meaning of the utility function becomes unclear because the
optimization will favour the objective function which is numerically dominant.

An efficient solution to avoid numerical dominance is to scale the objective functions so that they are 
constrained to the same approximate range of values, at least in the end of the optimization. However, as 
in the original implementation of the CLHS by Minasny and McBratney (2006), \code{optimCLHS} uses the 
naive aggregation method, which ignores that the three objective functions have different units and orders 
of magnitude. The same aggregation procedure is implemented in the \pkg{clhs} package. The effect of 
ignoring the need to scale the objective functions on the spatial modelling outcome still is poorly 
understood.
}
}
\note{
The distance between two points is computed as the Euclidean distance between them. This computation 
assumes that the optimization is operating in the two-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. the coordinates of
the sample points and candidate locations should not be provided as latitude/longitude. \pkg{spsann} has no 
mechanism to check if the coordinates are projected: the user is responsible for making sure that this
requirement is attained.

The (only) difference of \code{optimCLHS} to the original Fortran implementation of Minasny and McBratney
(2006), and to the \code{clhs} function implemented in the \pkg{\link[clhs]{clhs}} package by
Pierre Roudier, is the annealing schedule.
